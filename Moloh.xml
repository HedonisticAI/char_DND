Cantrips:
	You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level. 
	 
Spell Slots:
	The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. 
	 
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
	At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.
	You learn an additional warlock spell at 2nd through 9th level, and at every odd level thereafter. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
	 
Spellcasting Ability:
	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 
	 
Spellcasting Focus:
	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, several of which have spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.
	Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.
	 
Expanded Spell List:

On a succesful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.

	You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
	On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
